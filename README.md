# Introduction

## Background
Demographics is a major player in the outcome of elections and its ability to influence elections depends partly on the size of the group of people and how many voters from that group turn out to vote [(Hudak and Stenglein (2020))](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2016/09/13/how-demographic-changes-are-transforming-u-s-elections/). Analysis of turnout rates among minority populations shows why political power among communities of color has increased. It has been reported that turnout rates among African Americans, Latinos, and Asian Americans have increased considerably since the year 2000. Political strategists have therefore started tailoring messages to such groups in order to gain an electoral advantage. One group that must not be taken for granted is the Minority Millennial group. A survey conducted by The Black Youth Project at the University of Chicago reported millennials’ views of the issues of the day and the 2016 presidential candidates. It was revealed that while millennials tend to favor Democrats, principally in presidential elections, and communities of color vote similarly, the differences among young people of color show that millennials should not be automatically counted as a single voting block. Additionally, although minority millennials do favor the Democratic presidential candidate by a substantial margin (a characteristic that is true for African Americans, Latinos, and Asian Americans, 18 to 30 years of age) a large number of those polled are considering not voting.

Demographic shifts over the years have caused huge disruptions in the political world. In this paragraph, four of the biggest demographic trends shaping politics will be discussed [(Knight (2020))](https://www.axios.com/demographic-shifts-what-matters-2020-424161bf-1e6e-4da9-b2b2-9a6b2b2099fa.html). The first shift is the liberal youth revolution. Millennial and Gen Z Americans are seen to be sticking with the Democratic Party as they mature into adulthood. They have embraced "liberalism" and "socialism". If they are incentivized to get to the polls, Democrats they'd gain political power for the near future. The next shift is the older generations' growing voting power. The fraction of the electorate from older, more conservative generations is increasing as the massive baby boomer generation ages and life expectancy rises. In addition to this, the older generation has expendable income to invest in political candidates and parties and retirement-aged Americans have been seen to outvote young people. The third important shift is the shrinking of white America. Reports based on census data show that since 2010, non-Hispanic white people have lost their majority in 32 U.S. counties. The last shift is “The great rural exodus”.  Rural America is currently spiraling downwards. The percentage of Americans living in urban areas is rising fast as the population grows. This is shown by the 46 million more people who now live in urban areas (since 2000). States with the highest population density(New Jersey, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Connecticut and Maryland) tend to be Democratic and coastal according to [World Population Review (2020)](https://worldpopulationreview.com/states/state-densities/).

“[Voter ID laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_ID_laws_in_the_United_States) in the United States are laws that require a person to provide some form of official identification before they are permitted to register to vote, receive a ballot for an election, or to actually vote in elections in the United States”. Usually, the requirements of voter ID vary state by state. For some “strict” states, polls will not be counted unless valid ID has been shown. The NCSL [(National Conference of State Legislatures)](https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/voter-id.aspx) has categorized the severity of these laws at five levels: Photo ID required (strict); Photo ID required (non-strict); Non-photo ID required(strict); Non-photo ID requested (non-strict); No ID required to vote at ballot box. 

Recently, many researchers have analyzed the relationship between the severity of vote laws and voter turnout. Reducing minority voters caused by racial discrimination is hotly debated and often discussed in the context of African Americans [(Primus, 2010)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/20775015?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents). [Henninger, Meredith and Morse (2018)](https://esra.wisc.edu/papers/HMM.pdf) state that voter ID laws can disproportionately disenfranchise minority voters since non-white voters are more likely than white voters to lack photo ID. Also, a 2012 study in the city of Boston indicates that non-white voters are more likely to be asked for ID [(Rachael et al, 2014)]( https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1625041). However, [Alvarez et al (2007)]( https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/96594) has found that the stricter voter identiﬁcation requirements depress turnout to a greater extent for less educated and lower income populations. A small increase in Democratic turnout will be caused by new voter ID laws, which means the strong negative reaction to voter ID Laws among Democratic constituencies could increase the Democratic turnout [Milyo, 2007](https://www.in.gov/sos/elections/files/EffectsPhotographicIdentificationVoter_-_Jeffrey_Milyo.pdf); [Valentino, 2016)](https://www.worldcat.org/title/political-psychology-journal-of-the-international-society-of-political-psychology/oclc/66950841). Also, in 2019, by using Rhodes Island as a case study, [Esposite et al(2019)](https://www.nber.org/papers/w25503) found that the implementation of photo ID led to a decline in turnout for those who did not have driver licenses. 
 
Overall, after the 2010 election, 25 states have implemented new restrictions but these have been the subject of significant debate [(Brennan Center for Justice, 2019)](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/new-voting-restrictions-america). The proponents state it will decrease voter fraud and discourage non-citizens from voting, increase public confidence in the integrity of democracy, and ensure a one-vote-per-person system [(Spakocsky, 2012)](https://www.usnews.com/debate-club/should-photo-id-be-required-to-vote/voter-id-laws-protect-the-integrity-of-our-democracy). The opponents argue that it will disproportionately disadvantage black and Latino voters, the elderly, people with past criminal convictions, and students [(Rocha & Matsubayashi, 2014)](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/ebae/a2e713c62f19004c57894fd38398b998960e.pdf?_ga=2.221962072.1117407631.1585975384-1554961354.1585975384); They also contend that voting fraud is so rare that requiring an ID is unnecessary and costly [(Lott, 2006)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=925611).

The citizens’ participation in elections is as vital as its existence in the United States. Voter turnout (GGD: you have already discussed voter turn out above, so this defition should be moved up), which is the percentage of the eligible voters, who vote for a candidate or a party, is very important for delegating representatives and expressing citizens’ opinion in politics [(Campbell, et al 1981)](https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=JeYUrs_GOcMC&oi=fnd&pg=PA18&dq=Campbell,+Angus,+Philip+E.+Converse,+Warren+E.+Miller,+and+Donald+E.+Stokes.+The+american+voter.+University+of+Chicago+Press,+1980.&ots=wGiCCHXpw7&sig=D8o88pfKXmonSJyPnRj6yAtBiis#v=onepage&q=Campbell%2C%20Angus%2C%20Philip%20E.%20Converse%2C%20Warren%20E.%20Miller%2C%20and%20Donald%20E.%20Stokes.%20The%20american%20voter.%20University%20of%20Chicago%20Press%2C%201980.&f=false). Voter turnout is a significant indicator of a healthy democracy [(Essays, UK., 2018)](<https://www.ukessays.com/essays/politics/the-importance-of-voter-turnout-politics-essay.php?vref=1>). There are factors that affects voter turnout. Electoral competitiveness, election type, demographics and voting laws play crucial role on voter turnout [(Fair Vote)]( https://www.fairvote.org/what_affects_voter_turnout_rates). Demographics characteristics are one of the most important predictor of voter turnout. Those characteristics such as race, sex, religion, income, education level etc., are highly correlated with political participation [(Brady, et al, 1995)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/beyond-ses-a-resource-model-of-political-participation/CE74BA78807755F0A09E589D631EB03E). Competitiveness is also another important factor that appeals citizens’ attention on elections. Some election types seem to be less important than others for citizens. Voting laws suppress voter turnout, particularly among those who are demographically disadvantaged and lack the resources to overcome the maze of bureaucratic requirements [(Kelley, et al, 1967)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/registration-and-voting-putting-first-things-first1/980C4232B8DF72D99DE1551FB2E660A6). Rosenstone and Wolfinger even argue that “registration is more difficult than voting.” [(Rosenstone, Wolfinger, 1978)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/effect-of-registration-laws-on-voter-turnout/E9ED1FC9155FE2CB1874D67C40F4591F) (GGD: the sentences in this paragraph have information that should be integrated throughout the previous text. It is out of place here as you have already discussed voter participation above as well as very forms of voter suppression, etc.)




## Problem Statement

This project will investigate two primary issues relating to voting-eligible demographics, voter ID requirements and voter turnout. The scope of this study has been restricted to the 2016 presidential election. While the results from this study may not necessarily be extrapolated to all local and national elections, our goal is to provide an initial exploration of the correlations among demographics, voter ID laws and voter turnout.
The first problem of this project will investigate how voter ID requirements differ among states with varying demographic populations. Questions we will seek to answer include
What is the relationship between minority populations and voter ID 

*   What is the relationship between minority populations and voter ID requirements? (For example: Do states with higher minority populations have stricter voter ID requirements?)

*   What is the correlation between education level and voter ID requirements? (For example: Do states with a lower proportion of college graduates have stricter voter ID requirements?)
*   What is the relationship between income and voter ID requirements? (For example: Do states with a lower median household income have stricter voter ID requirements?)

*   What is the correlation between the proportion of young voters and voter ID requirements? (For example: Do states with a higher proportion of young voters have stricter voter ID requirements?)

These questions will be used to evaluate the correlation between demographic characteristics and voter ID laws. By looking at various demographic characteristics across the states, we would like to find the possible driver of the voter ID laws, see which characteristic might have a higher probability to enact voter ID laws. This correlation will be used to inform discussions and decision making regarding the enacting of these laws more broadly. This study will not try to uncover biases that are not there, but merely explore the space and see if any exist. 

The second problem our project will investigate is how voter turnout rates are affected by demographic makeup at the county level. Questions we will seek to answer include



*   Do states with higher minority populations have lower turnout rates?

*   How does the voter turnout of counties with a higher percentage of college graduates compare to counties with a lower percentage of college graduates?

*   How does median household income impact election turnout rates?

*   How does the voter turnout in counties with a younger voting-eligible population compare to voter turnout in counties with an older voting-eligible population?

These questions will investigate which demographic groups are less likely to vote within the context of the 2016 election, and explore how voter turnout scales with the demographics of a county as well as the extent to which voter turnout can be predicted by a county’s demographic composition.
In conjunction with the second problem explored in this project, we would like to explore whether voter ID requirements influence voter turnout rates. It is inherently reasonable to assume that voter turnout is higher in states with more relaxed laws, and vice versa. This study will explore that hypothesis and examine whether voter turnout rates are more accurately predicted when including voter ID requirements with county demographic information.

The following graphic is a representation of the relationships this project seeks to explore.

# Data Exploration

## Data Description

All of the datasets in this research are publicly available. The geospatial files, which includes shapefiles for each county and states in the US, are come from the [Census Bureau’s MAF/TIGER](https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/carto-boundary-file.html) geographic database. For the states’ geospatial data, it includes each states’ name, FIPS code, and shapefiles. For the counties’ geospatial data, it has each county’s name, FIPS code, state FIPS code, and shapefiles. The Census Bureau’s MAF/TIGER geographic database do not include demographic data but the FIPS code could be linked to other datasets. 

The purpose of using geospatial data is to visualize each characteristic of demographics in both state and county levels by merging geospatial data with demographics data. Also, we will apply the same mechanism for the voter ID laws dataset and the voter turnout dataset. Hence, we can map the demographic characteristics, the voter ID laws of the states and the voter turnout rates in both county and state levels. 

  Our [County Characteristics Data](https://data.world/data4democracy/election-transparency/workspace/file?filename=CountyCharacteristics.csv)  contains extensive demographic information for all counties in the US. The dataset is owned by [Data for Democracy](https://datafordemocracy.org/), a group whose mission is to unite a functioning, enthusiastic network of individuals utilizing data to drive better choices and improve the world where we live. The dataset was compiled from the 2015 5-year ACS, but also includes data from the BEA, CDC, BLS, as well as a couple of other sources. The demographics’ characteristic is represented by four dimensions: education level, age, race, income, and employment situation. In terms of education level, we look at the fraction of people who has bachelor or higher degree. 
Then, we only look at the people who are older than 18. We have separated our age to three types:
* younger than 34
* people of ages 35 to 59
* people 60 and older

This is how we define "young people", "middle-aged people", and "older people". It is important to note that the age ranges are not the same size and that the data is biased in this way. I.e., a population is more likely to have a higher population of middle aged people than young people, as the age range for what defines a middle-aged person is much larger (24 years compared to 16). This is acceptable as long as we confine our comparisons to counties-to-county and not age group-to-age group. Meaning, we will only compare a county's proportion of young people to other counties's proportion of young voters, and not to the same county's proportion of middle-aged people. Due to the nature of the original dataset, making equally-sized age ranges was not possible.

Since the previous research has indicated the disparate voter turnout could be caused by race, we use the fraction of minority(no white) to evaluate the influence across the state. At last, considering the various economic development level in each county, we are using unemployment rate and the median household income to serve as economic factor.

The demographics dataset is one of the main pillars of the study. By using the demographics data, we will examine the correlations between demographic characteristics and voter ID laws, and demographics and voter turnout. In the first part of the study, we will test how [demographics affect voter ID requirements](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1953251). Briefly, we focus on particular demographic characteristics such as median household income, age, ethnicity, education of states in order to uncover if there are any biases towards certain parts of demographics.  In the second part of the study, we investigate the correlation between demographics and voter turnout. So, we can examine the conjunctive effect of demographics and voter ID laws on voter turnout. 

The [voter ID requirements data](https://data.world/data4democracy/election-transparency/workspace/file?filename=States.csv) contains information regarding the voter ID law to which each state adheres. This dataset is also owned by [Data for Democracy](https://datafordemocracy.org/). According to [NCSL(National Conference of State Legislatures)](https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/voter-id.aspx), there are five types of voter ID law, which can be categorized in two ways. First, the laws can be sorted by whether the state asks for a photo ID (e.g,. Driver’s license) or whether it accepts IDs (e.g,. bank statement) without a photo as well. Second, the laws can be divided by what actions are available for voters who do not have ID. States accept affidavit or vouch, it belongs to the “non-strict” type. States required additional steps after Election Day belong to “strict” type. Overall, the five categories of photo ID are: Photo ID required (strict), Photo ID required (non-strict), Non-photo ID required(strict), Non-photo ID requested (non-strict), No ID required to vote at ballot box.

The voter ID requirements dataset contributes in two ways. First, we will examine the correlation between demographic characteristics and voter ID requirements. Therefore, we can observe if there is a bias towards a particular demographic group. Second, we want to see whether voter ID laws affect voter turnout. If there is a kind of bias towards a certain demographic group with more strict ID requirements, then, it is not possible to mention a healthy democracy in such state or states. Hence, voter ID requirements dataset helps us to investigate the representativeness all demographic groups in the U.S. elections. 

Last but not least, our voter turnout contains the election results for the 2016 presidential election. The [2016 US County Level Presidential Results Data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tonmcg/US_County_Level_Election_Results_08-16/master/2016_US_County_Level_Presidential_Results.csv) is owned by GitHub user [@tonmcg](https://github.com/tonmcg/US_County_Level_Election_Results_08-16/), founder and data scientist at emdata.ai. The data was originally collected by [TownHall](https://townhall.com/election/2016/president/).com, a conservative website that "pulls together political commentary and analysis from over 100 leading columnists and opinion leaders, research from 100 partner organizations, conservative talk-radio and a community of millions of grassroots conservatives." In this data, we acquire the total votes for each counties. By merging the data according to the FIPS code. We calculate the voter turnout rate, which is the percentage of eligible voters who cast a ballot in an election. The voter turnout rate is equal to the total votes divided by total eligible persons in 2016. A limitation of our analysis is that our voting eligible population metric comes from 2015, while the elction took place a year later. We assume population movements are small enough that they can be ignored. We also only have aggregated county results, and no conditional results regarding specific demographic groups. These data are typically gathered by extrapolating survey results, but do not exist concretely. This will limit our ability to make any concrete claims about individuals within demographic groups; we can only find correlations between counties that exhibit certain demogprahic features and the turnout.

The focus of the study is to understand the factors that affect voter turnout based on the 2016 presidential elections data in the United States. The data helps us to see the voter turnout rates in both county and state levels. Thus, we can study how demographics and voter ID laws affect voter turnout rates.

In general, since our research is focusing on the comparison across the counties/states. We are mainly using proportions to unify standards




## Data Limitations

[Census Bureau’s MAF/TIGER](https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/carto-boundary-file.html) geographic database is compiled from different secondary resource maps and materials produced by the national mapping agencies, other government departments and [international agencies](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/demog/docs/symposium_08.htm). 
The database has [limitations](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/technical-documentation/naming-convention/cartographic-boundary-file.html
) and these files should not be used for:
geographic analysis including area or perimeter calculation.
geocoding addresses.
determining precise geographic area relationships.
The geographic areas may also not align with the same areas from another year.


It is worth mentioning that [Content Editing](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/tech_docs/accuracy/MultiyearACSAccuracyofData2018.pdf?#) was conducted on the ACS data. This means that after data collection was completed, the remaining incomplete or inconsistent information was imputed during the final content edit of the collected data. As was done in other surveys and previous censuses, unacceptable entries were assigned to entries for persons or housing units with similar characteristics. Imputing acceptable values in place of blanks or unacceptable entries was done to enhance the usefulness of the data.

Also, data from ACS is only available for geographic areas with a total population of at least [65,000]( http://mcdc.missouri.edu/help/ten-things/ACS.html). This is done to avoid creating tables where the sample size would result in large standard errors (sampling error) [(ACS 5-year 2014-2018)](https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2018/acs/acs_general_handbook_2018_ch02.pdf
).

Our data is limited by few counts of missing information. This first limitation to note is that the value used for the count of young people is not exact. The original dataset only provided the population size of the age range `15-19`. However, the minimum voting age in the United States is 18. We made the assumption that the population of each age in that range is evenly distributed. 40% of this value (representing voting ages 18 and 19) were used in the counts of young people. Also, a single county (Oglala Lakota County) in South Dakota is missing from the turnout dataset. Because it is only one out of over 3000 counties, we are okay moving forward without this piece of information. Finally, Alaska only reported their election results at the state level.; county-specific results are unavailable. For this reason, county-specific analyses cannot be conducted when considering the state of Alaska. This should not affect the analyses of this study, as it is only one state being excluded.




## Data Visualizations

### Demographic Data

![median household income chart](pictures/median_household_income.png)
This figure shows the median household income of each county in the US. The wealthiest counties are those in the Northeastern corridor, as well as those surrounding the San Francisco Bay area and Midwest. Some counties in the midwest are also wealthier. However, the dark shade of the plot highlights how many counties across the US have median household incomes around $40,000 or lower, especially those in the southeast.


![education rate chart](pictures/college_graduates.png)
This figure shows the percentage of voting eligble persons in each county that hold either a Bachelor's or Master's degree. The most educated counties are those in the Northeastern corridor, as well as those in Colorado. Counties in the mountain states (Arizona, Idaho, Nevada, and Utah) appear to have lower rates of college education. Spread across the nation are counties with high rates, but they are sparse and few.


![median age chart](pictures/median_age.png)
This figure shows the median age of each county in the US. This feature appears to be evenly distributed across the Eastern half of the country. Southern Florida, as well as the Northern most regions of the country, appear to have older populations. The mountain states appear to have younger populations.


![age distributions chart](pictures/age_distributions.png)
This figure shows the percentage of voting eligible persons in each county that fall into distinct age categories. The largest category for nearly all counties is the `Age 35 to 59` bucket. The age range is the largest of the three, however. These figures are mostly evenly distributed.


![unemployment rate chart](pictures/unemployment_rate.png)
This figure shows the unemployment rate of voting eligible persons in each county in the US. The unemployment rate tends to be higher in southern counties than in northern ones. Counties in the Boston and midwest regions have very low unemployment rates.


### Voter ID Requirements


This figure shows the voting ID laws that each state subscribes to. There are five classes of voting ID requirements. Most states touching the southern border of the US fall into the 3 strictes categories. The states adhering to the strictest ID policy are all on the eastern side of the country. The northeastern and western-most states make up the most voter-friendly states, as they have very relaxed ID policies.


This figure shows the number of states that fall into the different voting ID law categories. The plot shows that more states favor relaxed ID laws than strict ones.

### Voter Turnout Data

This figure shows the percentage of voting eligible persons that casted a ballot in the 2016 Presidential general election. The turnout rate was relatively high nationwide. Turnout rates in the counties along the southwestern counties were much lower than those in northern counties. Counties in the Great Plains, Colorado, and Boston regions had the highest turnout rates.
