# Introduction

## Background
Demographics is a major player in the outcome of elections and its ability to influence elections depends partly on the size of the group of people and how many voters from that group turn out to vote [(Hudak and Stenglein (2020))](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2016/09/13/how-demographic-changes-are-transforming-u-s-elections/). Analysis of turnout rates among minority populations shows why political power among communities of color has increased. It has been reported that turnout rates among African Americans, Latinos, and Asian Americans have increased considerably since the year 2000. Political strategists have therefore started tailoring messages to such groups in order to gain an electoral advantage. One group that must not be taken for granted is the Minority Millennial group. A survey conducted by The Black Youth Project at the University of Chicago reported millennials’ views of the issues of the day and the 2016 presidential candidates. It was revealed that while millennials tend to favor Democrats, principally in presidential elections, and communities of color vote similarly, the differences among young people of color show that millennials should not be automatically counted as a single voting block. Additionally, although minority millennials do favor the Democratic presidential candidate by a substantial margin (a characteristic that is true for African Americans, Latinos, and Asian Americans, 18 to 30 years of age) a large number of those polled are considering not voting.

Demographic shifts over the years have caused huge disruptions in the political world. In this paragraph, four of the biggest demographic trends shaping politics will be discussed [(Knight (2020))](https://www.axios.com/demographic-shifts-what-matters-2020-424161bf-1e6e-4da9-b2b2-9a6b2b2099fa.html). The first shift is the liberal youth revolution. Millennial and Gen Z Americans are seen to be sticking with the Democratic Party as they mature into adulthood. They have embraced "liberalism" and "socialism". If they are incentivized to get to the polls, Democrats they'd gain political power for the near future. The next shift is the older generations' growing voting power. The fraction of the electorate from older, more conservative generations is increasing as the massive baby boomer generation ages and life expectancy rises. In addition to this, the older generation has expendable income to invest in political candidates and parties and retirement-aged Americans have been seen to outvote young people. The third important shift is the shrinking of white America. Reports based on census data show that since 2010, non-Hispanic white people have lost their majority in 32 U.S. counties. The last shift is “The great rural exodus”.  Rural America is currently spiraling downwards. The percentage of Americans living in urban areas is rising fast as the population grows. This is shown by the 46 million more people who now live in urban areas (since 2000). States with the highest population density(New Jersey, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Connecticut and Maryland) tend to be Democratic and coastal according to [World Population Review (2020)](https://worldpopulationreview.com/states/state-densities/).

“[Voter ID laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_ID_laws_in_the_United_States) in the United States are laws that require a person to provide some form of official identification before they are permitted to register to vote, receive a ballot for an election, or to actually vote in elections in the United States”. Usually, the requirements of voter ID vary state by state. For some “strict” states, polls will not be counted unless valid ID has been shown. The NCSL [(National Conference of State Legislatures)](https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/voter-id.aspx) has categorized the severity of these laws at five levels: Photo ID required (strict); Photo ID required (non-strict); Non-photo ID required(strict); Non-photo ID requested (non-strict); No ID required to vote at ballot box. 

Recently, many researchers have analyzed the relationship between the severity of vote laws and voter turnout. Reducing minority voters caused by racial discrimination is hotly debated and often discussed in the context of African Americans [(Primus, 2010)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/20775015?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents). [Henninger, Meredith and Morse (2018)](https://esra.wisc.edu/papers/HMM.pdf) state that voter ID laws can disproportionately disenfranchise minority voters since non-white voters are more likely than white voters to lack photo ID. Also, a 2012 study in the city of Boston indicates that non-white voters are more likely to be asked for ID [(Rachael et al, 2014)]( https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1625041). However, [Alvarez et al (2007)]( https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/96594) has found that the stricter voter identiﬁcation requirements depress turnout to a greater extent for less educated and lower income populations. A small increase in Democratic turnout will be caused by new voter ID laws, which means the strong negative reaction to voter ID Laws among Democratic constituencies could increase the Democratic turnout [Milyo, 2007](https://www.in.gov/sos/elections/files/EffectsPhotographicIdentificationVoter_-_Jeffrey_Milyo.pdf); [Valentino, 2016)](https://www.worldcat.org/title/political-psychology-journal-of-the-international-society-of-political-psychology/oclc/66950841). Also, in 2019, by using Rhodes Island as a case study, [Esposite et al(2019)](https://www.nber.org/papers/w25503) found that the implementation of photo ID led to a decline in turnout for those who did not have driver licenses. 
 
Overall, after the 2010 election, 25 states have implemented new restrictions but these have been the subject of significant debate [(Brennan Center for Justice, 2019)](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/new-voting-restrictions-america). The proponents state it will decrease voter fraud and discourage non-citizens from voting, increase public confidence in the integrity of democracy, and ensure a one-vote-per-person system [(Spakocsky, 2012)](https://www.usnews.com/debate-club/should-photo-id-be-required-to-vote/voter-id-laws-protect-the-integrity-of-our-democracy). The opponents argue that it will disproportionately disadvantage black and Latino voters, the elderly, people with past criminal convictions, and students [(Rocha & Matsubayashi, 2014)](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/ebae/a2e713c62f19004c57894fd38398b998960e.pdf?_ga=2.221962072.1117407631.1585975384-1554961354.1585975384); They also contend that voting fraud is so rare that requiring an ID is unnecessary and costly [(Lott, 2006)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=925611).

The citizens’ participation in elections is as vital as its existence in the United States. Voter turnout (GGD: you have already discussed voter turn out above, so this defition should be moved up), which is the percentage of the eligible voters, who vote for a candidate or a party, is very important for delegating representatives and expressing citizens’ opinion in politics [(Campbell, et al 1981)](https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=JeYUrs_GOcMC&oi=fnd&pg=PA18&dq=Campbell,+Angus,+Philip+E.+Converse,+Warren+E.+Miller,+and+Donald+E.+Stokes.+The+american+voter.+University+of+Chicago+Press,+1980.&ots=wGiCCHXpw7&sig=D8o88pfKXmonSJyPnRj6yAtBiis#v=onepage&q=Campbell%2C%20Angus%2C%20Philip%20E.%20Converse%2C%20Warren%20E.%20Miller%2C%20and%20Donald%20E.%20Stokes.%20The%20american%20voter.%20University%20of%20Chicago%20Press%2C%201980.&f=false). Voter turnout is a significant indicator of a healthy democracy [(Essays, UK., 2018)](<https://www.ukessays.com/essays/politics/the-importance-of-voter-turnout-politics-essay.php?vref=1>). There are factors that affects voter turnout. Electoral competitiveness, election type, demographics and voting laws play crucial role on voter turnout [(Fair Vote)]( https://www.fairvote.org/what_affects_voter_turnout_rates). Demographics characteristics are one of the most important predictor of voter turnout. Those characteristics such as race, sex, religion, income, education level etc., are highly correlated with political participation [(Brady, et al, 1995)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/beyond-ses-a-resource-model-of-political-participation/CE74BA78807755F0A09E589D631EB03E). Competitiveness is also another important factor that appeals citizens’ attention on elections. Some election types seem to be less important than others for citizens. Voting laws suppress voter turnout, particularly among those who are demographically disadvantaged and lack the resources to overcome the maze of bureaucratic requirements [(Kelley, et al, 1967)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/registration-and-voting-putting-first-things-first1/980C4232B8DF72D99DE1551FB2E660A6). Rosenstone and Wolfinger even argue that “registration is more difficult than voting.” [(Rosenstone, Wolfinger, 1978)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/effect-of-registration-laws-on-voter-turnout/E9ED1FC9155FE2CB1874D67C40F4591F) (GGD: the sentences in this paragraph have information that should be integrated throughout the previous text. It is out of place here as you have already discussed voter participation above as well as very forms of voter suppression, etc.)
